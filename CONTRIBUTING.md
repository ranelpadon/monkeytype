- NodeJS v10
- Firebase

## Project Setup

1. [Create a new Firebase project.](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)

   - The project name doesn't really matter, but just name it `monkeytype`.
   - Google Analytics is not necessary.

2. [Install the Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
3. Run `firebase login` on your terminal to log in to the same google account as you just used to create the project.
4. Git clone this project.
5. Run `npm install` in the `functions/` directory
6. Compile `public/css/style.scss` to `public/css/style.min.css` as [described below](https://github.com/Miodec/monkeytype/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#standards--conventions)
7. Rename `.firebaserc_example` to `.firebaserc` and change the project name of default to the firebase project id you just created.

   - If `.firebaserc_example` does not exist after cloning, create your own with:

   ```.firebaserc
    {
        "projects": {
            "default": "your-firebase-project-id",
        }
    }
   ```

   - Run `firebase projects:list` to find your firebase project id.

8. Generate a Firebase Admin private key

   - In your Firebase console, go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
   - Click "Generate New Private Key"
   - Save as `serviceAccountKey.json` in the `functions/` directory

9. Run `firebase serve` to start a local server on port 5000. Use ctrl+c to stop it.
   - Run `firebase use default` if you run into any errors for this.

## Standards & Conventions

1. Use a SCSS compiler, and make sure that a `style.min.css` file is generated in the same directory as the `style.scss`. For VSCode I recommend `Easy Sass` extension by Wojciech Sura. After installing it, to configure it:

   - Navigate to the VSCode settings, `Extensions` section and find `Easy Sass configuration`
   - Under the `Formats` group click `edit in settings.json`
   - Make sure this the code looks like this:

   ```json
   "easysass.formats": [
       {
           "format": "compressed",
           "extension": ".min.css"
       }
   ],
   ```

   _This will make sure that only a minified file is generated._

   -Finally, using the command palete (`ctrl/cmd + shift + p`), use the `Compile all SCSS/SASS files in the project` option. You only need to do this once. After this the files will be compiled on save.

2. Install [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html). Its a code formatter, and it will make sure that we avoid any whitespace or formatting issues when merging code.
